Final project for Code 201 with Ophelia, Jen and Alejandro




Task List
Set up project repo, everyone else clone
Fri: vote for project idea, our plans should be very detailed, including site architecture, wireframes of your pages, diagrams of how you are going to organize and solve your problem domain in code (including all points for user input and what the handlers for each of those points will do), plus anything else that you've worked out in advance (naming conventions for variables, for instance, plus things like Git process, branch/issue names, color palettes, custom font selections, whatever goes into the project.
set up slack
Ground Rule

No Merge to Group Repo Master until everyone is together
ACP often to local branch, but have a member proof read before PR, call merge party
NO PUSH to MASTER. After merge conflict resolved, ACP to local branch and continue work on that branch
whenever there is bothering you, when speak up, everyone gathers.
everyone be at Code Fellow 9-5
group stand-up meeting at 9
